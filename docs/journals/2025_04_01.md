- Trying to separate test memory from Engine
- Currently issues as we need to create an upfront hashmap<string, test_result> and a string to store the name of the current test.
- When test finishes and we either re-alloc or alloc in to the hashmap, the global new / delete operators have been overriden so are trying to free memory from the engine heap which does not exist within the engine's Global Memory Space.
